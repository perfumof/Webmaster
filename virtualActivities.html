    <h2>2 Main Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
    <p><br></p>
    <div class = "rowtwo">
      <div class = "columntwo">
        <h4>Agricultural Runoff</h4> 
        <p><br>The main source of water pollution is through runoff. Pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, oil, arsenic, other toxic chemicals, bacteria and viruses, etc.</p>
        <p><br><br><br><br>Agricultural Runoff - In the US, agricultural runoff is the main reason for water contamination. Floods or rain carries the runoff from farms into rivers, lakes, streams, and groundwater which then contaminates the water. Animal waste handle improperly can also end up contaminating waters with bacterial infections.</p>
        <p><br>Nutrient Runoff - Agricultural runoff causes an excesses amount of phosphorus and nitrogen which causes an overgrowth of algae. Algae blooms negatively affect animals and contaminate the waters. 30 to 40 million Americans get water contaminated from algae blooms.</p>

        <h4>Wastewater Dumping</h4>
        <p><br>In developed countries, only 70% of waste water is treated, the rest is placed back into waterways without treatment. "The National Resources Defense Council reports that unsafe contaminants, from arsenic to lead, have been found in the tap water of every state in the country"(cite).</p>
        <p><br><br>Industrial Waste - Fracking, a process, harmful to the environment that produces gasoline, creaes large amounts of wastewater. Gasoline or oil spills in our oceans or lakes also contaminate waters.</p>
        <p><br>City Sewage - 2 billion people in the world drink water contaminated with feces, containing bacterial diseases. In the US, sewer overflows cause 850 billion gallons of raw sewage and wastewater spill into fresh waterways.</p>
